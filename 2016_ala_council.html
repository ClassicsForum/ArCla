<!-- To make this next year:
  * Download candidate spreadsheet
  * Search-replace all commas with an unlikely character, such as }
  * Export to CSV
  * Use a CSV-to-HTML converter to make the table (I used http://xmlgrid.net/csvToHtml.html)
  * Copy-paste this into a 2016 file
  * Replace the table in the 2016 file with your new table
  * Search/replace to be sure that "AILA", "APALA", "BCALA", and "CALA" are used in the ethnic
    caucus columns, not just the fully-spelled-out versions
  * Search/replace the } to turn it back into ,
  * Search/replace &amp; to &amp; (and then fix the && in the Javascript, and this line)
  * Test to see if it works. Who knows what the data format is. In particular, the nth-child
    selectors are all totally fragile around column reordering. (Protip: the nth-child selector
    is 1-indexed because what is this, Mars?)
  * Search/replace <tr> with <tr class="initial-show"> (except in this line)
  * Update the voting button if needed.

               <td>Libraries are the great equalizers in society, giving many the leg up needed to succeed in life.  Libraries are also there to make lives richer, offering escape, entertainment, and opportunities for discovery.  While libraries are sacred to those of us in the profession and to our power users, they are sometimes seen as indispensable or less relevant to others in this age of instant gratification.  
We have to make the case that libraries matter, are relevant, and can make a difference in the lives of those we serve.  Having an association that has voice potent enough to speak for libraries is vital. When funding is scarce and libraries must compete for ever shrinking funding, it is ALA that libraries turn to for support and guidance.  Council needs fresh voices and perspectives who can guide the association and libraries through the challenges ahead.</td>

These are all great accomplishments in which I cherish, however none compare to the book club that I began a couple of years ago at EPCC. The idea of bringing faculty, students and staff together for the enjoyment of reading is a huge highlight. There is nothing better than to see the increase of literacy especially among young students. Today our book club is thriving, we meet once a month and have even included a potluck lunch to go with our event. Students are excited, not only to read, but to discuss what they read with fellow students, staff and faculty members. Many of my colleagues have not only sent their students to our book club, but they have also joined our group.</td>

It is a champion of the basic human need of knowledge. ALA has given me a sense of direction, research assistance, networking and more important a sense of pride in the profession I love. The appointment of ALA council is an exciting position where serious decisions are made that affect not only the organization, but the profession as well. My experience in leadership on a national and local level have prepared me for such a role. I feel that I can work with my fellow colleagues and the leadership team to continue moving ALA forward.

Since 2009, ALA membership has been declining steadily. The organization now has 10,000 fewer members than a decade ago; our current membership is lower than it was in 1992. If elected Councilor-at-Large, I will work with the Council to investigate the different factors that have contributed to our declining membership.

               <td>Libraries across the country are facing budgetary crises for several reasons, some of which are listed below. I believe legislative advocacy and the application of economic pressure are the best ways to counteract the detrimental effects on our services, staff and resources. We must speak out and recruit our communities to speak out with us! 

Political trends toward government service cut-backs disproportionately impact social programs like education and libraries. Stagnant budgets are further compacted by inflation. We can't retain access to the same amount of information, thereby reducing the public's and higher education's  access to publicly funded research. Widely accepted public perception that "everything is available on the internet" has undermined the role of libraries and librarians as information stewards, facilitators, and managers of information.</td>

With so many challenges, changes, and new opportunities facing our profession, ALA is needed more than ever before. Yet for the Council to remain effective, it must be a microcosm of the profession.

I believe library staff can create a more tolerant, equitable, open and just world--- program by program, resource by resource, community connection by community connection.</td>

The system serves more than 800,000 residents with 22 libraries and 580 staff members. In 2015 circulation will surpass 15.5 million with 4.5 million visitors coming through our doors. Both circulation and library visits doubled during the past decade, which has provided opportunities for staff innovation in programming and new technologies to manage our growth. During my tenure the library has pioneered library services inside jails and health clinics as well as expanded services for refugees, at-risk youth and special needs populations. I have overseen planning and construction of 11 libraries including six new LEED-certified buildings.  We’ve substantially renovated all other branches, moved our headquarters and data center operations, and opened a new 25,000 square-foot event center and amphitheater. Where appropriate, we have co-located libraries with other County service agencies. I am especially proud of the West Jordan Library and Viridian Event Center that has quickly become a popular new library-centered meeting and program venue for our community. Prior to becoming a Director I served as a Library Board Trustee from 1994 to 2001, with several terms as chair.  In my previous career managing public lands and natural resources, I represented Utah in negotiations with the U.S. Department of the Interior that resulted in the creation of the Grand Staircase/Escalante National Monument.</td>

This experience has put me in touch with a wide range of ALA members and ex-members who bravely ask how they can help. As Councilor-at-Large, I will continue to advocate for inclusivity in participation: new and seasoned professionals; those attending physically and those leading virtually; those already participating and those experiencing barriers. 

The charge of Council is not limited to the inner workings of the Association: it extends to the myriad ways in which we as library workers and affiliates operate among each other and among our communities. ALA enables libraries to transform; Council develops and champions the structure for that transformation.

For these reasons, I ask for your vote. Thank you for your consideration!</td>

At work, my proudest accomplishment has been to foster a safer environment for staff and patrons. I worked with team members to regain control of our environment and lobbied for a security presence. I created documentation for behavioral expectations for patrons that has been adapted by other libraries, and work closely with security personnel to maintain a library that is safe, open, and inviting.

In the absence of staff with web expertise, I managed the completion and launch of a Drupal website, with tremendous help from LISHost. It’s not award-winning but people find what they’re looking for. It’s amazing what you can do when you have to.

After a few years away, and reflection about what ALA is, what it means to librarianship, and what it meant to me early in my career, I’m ready to return. I’m ready to recommit myself to the organization and view service to ALA and ALA-APA Council as sort of an ambassadorship. If elected, I will be honored to help keep ALA relevant and moving forward.

Technology is not a replacement for a qualified librarian with a keen desire to serve their patrons, but it is a necessary tool to reach our goals of collaboration, innovation, and extension of library services. Advocating for the library and its services to all of our respective communities in public, academic, school and special libraries, strengthens these partnerships and should be at the center of every librarian's focus. Our world is changing and to keep up with the demands and costs of all libraries we must be "indispensable", to quote Hilda Weisberg, and continue to find creative solutions to show the world how special librarians are!</td>

I have also attended National Library Legislative Days in Washington, D.C. many times during the last 20 years.

Libraries are adapting to the usage of digital information and we must continue to connect our resources and services with community relevance and needs. An important part of embracing digital books and articles is education—teaching readers how to effectively navigate, read and store information in the digital environment. Print books will remain vital in many types of libraries, however the effective adoption and integration of digital books is an essential next step for libraries. As an ALA Councilor-at-Large, I will focus on promoting libraries as both a location for intellectual discovery and as a central community resource that is a leader in technological progress.</td>

Now, as a librarian in a large urban public library, I have learned what public libraries in that setting face on a daily basis. What I have learned most is that public libraries need strong leaders to help them survive and evolve as times - and cultures - change. Since starting my work with ALA, first on the Committee on Legislation, I have made the concerns of all public libraries, the rural and urban - a priority in my work with ALA. As a Councilor-at-Large, I will continue to work for the public libraries in all settings to ensure they have the tools and support they need to continue to evolve.</td>

Librarians in all types of communities and libraries need equal opportunities to serve, and to be informed of best library practices and services. Community members deserve equal access to information, technology, and services. They deserve libraries which are not afraid to reach out, and to help them reach their long term goals.

In the face of increasing acts of violence nationally and internationally including mass shootings at home and recent Paris terror attacks, I believe we can be that CHANGE by raising our voices and continuing to educate, provide information and increase the awareness.

As ALA Councilor-at-Large I would like to use my longstanding experience in international librarianship to PROMOTE the broader concerns of intellectual freedom, information privacy, and social justice. As academic librarian I would also like to FOCUS on the changing roles and responsibilities of library professionals, and a set of unique competencies and special skills they bring to their institutions in the changing landscape of American libraries.</td>

I do this by: integrating the library into formal and informal learning, demonstrating how design can make libraries better, exploring and explaining how the evolving information environment changes our users' expectations and experience of the library, coaching organizational change, and using this skill set to help shape the future of libraries. Specifically, I have done this at work through facilitating strategic planning processes and organizational change, innovative pilot projects, and extensive experience in teaching students. I have presented and published regularly in these areas in order to share my findings with the profession and to engage in professional dialogue about our work and what it looks like in a changing information environment.</td>

ALA could work more effectively and efficiently as an advocate for those we serve and for library workers. We need to maintain our commitment to the principles of equity, access, diversity, privacy, intellectual freedom, and education as we continuously re-position ourselves in our communities and institutions. ALA can help us be more powerful in these roles - as a profession and as individuals - but we must start by examining ALA itself and making sure that it has the capacity to effectively represent, support, and advocate.</td>

Sikh Americans have been harassed and called terrorist based upon the lack of knowledge about their religion. Moreover, SAFE ZONES are areas within a workplace, school or in our case a library where you have culturally competent and supportive allies to the LGBTQ community.

At a hospital library in the late 1970's, I worked with the Director of the library to be present at nurses shift change meetings to be a resource for them (an early embedded librarian??)
In the 1980s, my library was using the NOTIS ILS. We became early adopters of their serial checkin module, I worked with them to trouble shoot their product.
I developed a book delivery model based on Netflix for public library patrons. Books were mailed to homes, one at a time, they could keep them as long as they wanted and there was a return mailer included to send the material back to the library at no charge to the patron. 
Being a part of the Committee on Legislation, I have had the opportunity to be a part of resolutions that went to Congress and the President!</td>

I want our organization to support librarians in our current struggles. Every day I encounter people who do not know the resources, staff and services libraries offer. 

I also want to build community within our organization, I have witnessed many times where we are fractured. I want to promote and find the Unity in commUNITY. Thank you!</td>

Outside of higher education libraries are more critical to the success of our communities than ever. We have, after all, had our own paradigm shift in the last 15 years and we have emerged stronger than ever. Organizations like ALA and ACRL have a real opportunity to help our libraries and librarians help their institutions in these transitions and I would love to be a part of that by bringing that perspective to ALA Council.</td>

Opportunities to discover, make, create, share, connect, and read are cultivated in funded, supported, nourished, and valued libraries. In these spaces, some of the best stories come to life. 

Without great libraries/librarians, we are at risk. How can we empower and inspire library boards, school administrators, decision-makers, and users to transform today’s libraries? Expanding programs and access, offering innovative opportunities, creating partnerships with businesses and industry, rebranding our mission, and rejuvenating our vision will not happen without an impetus. The printed word has brought many through the doors of our libraries. The spoken word, our uplifting stories, must be that which transforms and reinvigorates our libraries. We must not tire of sharing the stories of how and why libraries and librarians matter.</td>
