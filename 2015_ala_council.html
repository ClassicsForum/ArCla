<!-- To make this next year:
  * Download candidate spreadsheet
  * Search-replace all commas with an unlikely character, such as }
  * Export to CSV
  * Use a CSV-to-HTML converter to make the table (see inline comment for the one I used)
  * Copy-paste this into a 2016 file
  * Replace the table in the 2016 file with your new table
  * Search/replace to be sure that "AILA", "APALA", "BCALA", and "CALA" are used in the ethnic
    caucus columns, not just the fully-spelled-out versions
  * Search/replace the } to turn it back into ,
  * Search/replace & to &amp;
  * Test to see if it works. Who knows what the data format is. In particular, the nth-child
    selectors are all totally fragile around column reordering. (Protip: the nth-child selector
    is 1-indexed because what is this, Mars?)
  * Update the voting button if needed.

          <td>I was fortunate in being able to develop and start a new high school library program in 2001 and I am currently still at the same school.  It has been very fulfilling to be able to prepare our students for the challenges of college research and for life after high school. As part of that preparation, I have coordinated visits from our public and academic librarians to the school and also encourage our students to seek out the help and resources available to them at these other libraries.  

What has especially pleased me about our library is that it has become a safe haven for a variety of students, which has led some of them to create new friendships that they might not have made outside of the library. I believe libraries can provide support in many ways. Although I feel my accomplishment is a strong, growing library program, it would not be possible without the interaction and collaboration of our students, faculty, parents and our local public and college librarians.</td>

I feel that all library programs are intertwined in our responsibility to our patrons. They rely on us at different times in their lives whether we are at a public, school or academic library. Our patrons and our programs benefit when we can communicate and collaborate across the different divisions of ALA. In order for this to occur, it is important for viewpoints from all of the divisions contribute to the decisions that affect us all.

I hope by becoming a member of the council that I can contribute to our growth as an evolving professional organization and help to foster and promote our shared goals and visions.</td>

For example, I taught myself and others basic word processing and HTML; co-developed our first web portal; played a leadership role in our migration from a mainframe to a client server LIS; led our screen design committee's efforts as the first U.S. library to migrate to Ex Libris's ALEPH 500; and converted ALA's IFRT Report from a print to an online publication.  I have taken a leadership role in the defense of intellectual freedom and free expression in local, state, and national venues through numerous presentations, publications and committees, including terms as chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committees of the Indiana Library Federation and the American Library Association.  In the latter role, I have successfully shepherded over twenty policy documents (Interpretations of the Library Bill of rights) through ALA Council's review and approval process for two successive editions of ALA's Intellectual Freedom Manual.</td>

Divisions deftly handle ALA’s education mission. As RUSA Councilor we were seeing less need for Midwinter, since technology allowed committees to work outside of conferences. RUSA created policies so members who wanted to participate not be fiscally committed to attend Midwinter. However, there is value in face-to-face events for professional development which is way I proposed a change in ALA policy to meet our member’s needs.  In the future, I hope to bring the needs of all ALA members, I will work to help ALA members understand resolution creation, debate, and outcome.

Libraries have seen a decline in the reverence for the written word and the preservation of history, the achievements of librarians have often been belittled or unacknowledged, funding disappearing going to the most political and not the most practical.  But libraries remained strong because there are library workers, young and old (not all librarians) who have a commitment to helping people find and use information.  

I am attempting for the third time to serve as Councilor-At-Large.  I have the experience, education and training and want to work with others to help libraries stay strong regardless of the changes we face or will have to face in the future.</td>

What will help preserve our libraries into the future is a nimble and flexible attitude. Weaving together our traditional services, technology, and the community spaces we have become we can do more than just give information. We can help our patrons engage with and create content in new ways while still being a tried and true public institution. My experience as a library activist has made me realize that we need to be "activists" in all aspects of our profession. We need to use the same passionate energy we use to advocate for our services to consistently work to make libraries even more amazing.</td>

ALA needs to continue to reinforce that libraries are more than books continuing to provide advocacy tools and continuing education opportunities for library staff, trustees and Friends.

The kitchen conversations that have taken place recently that will lead to a new strategic plan will help to guide the association as it continues to meet members' needs; grow membership; and become even more financially stable. As a member of Council, I will work with my colleagues to ensure that the voices of the members (and potential members) are heard and that the association develops programs and services that will help it maintain its relevance in the profession and in our society.</td>

We must continue to bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots in terms of technology access. I'm also interested in the changing role of libraries, moving form a repository of books and other information formats to centers of technology, community and innovation. Maintaining a balance of traditional and new library services is important as we work with our communities to help them understand the evolving role of the library and positive impact it can have on their lives beyond information access. My nearly twenty years of library experience, and as the director of an award-winning five-star library, I feel I have a unique perspective that would serve the members of ALA and the library profession well.</td>

I still feel, however, that more diversity in our profession is needed and I hope to assist in reaching that goal.</td>

However, serving on Council for three years, there will certainly be other issues and initiatives that will come to the attention of ALA members and I believe I can be an advocate for their concerns and interests.</td>

One of the major strengths of ALA is that we have a diverse type of libraries and librarians. By uniting together in one organization and valuing each and every type of library, we have the opportunity to be a loud voice. We all serve the same patrons - albeit at different points in their lives. It is important that for our entire library ecosystem to sustain itself, we have to all work together for all types of libraries.

This is my seventh year at this school and we are an urban fringe high school. This circulation increase reflects the exciting programs that the library has had to attract reluctant readers.  One of those programs this past year was bringing nine national authors to the school on one day.  They visited classrooms, had breakfast and lunch with students and conducted workshops. Other guest that day included our state superintendent, community partners that donated thousands of dollars for the event, public and school librarians from across the state and various media outlets to document the day. Students that never darkened the library doors were actually begging for books, and asking what to read next. I am very proud of the outcome.</td>

The Forum has hosted dozens of socials around Virginia and increased the number of new VLA members by over 100. We created a program track for new members for our annual state conference, and I have gotten wonderful feedback about how much more fun and meaningful both VLA and the conference are now.

None of my library school’s student association benefits were available to distance students, so I also founded a Virginia branch for my classmates. Among other virtual programs, I coordinated two find-a-job panels, one of which ended up being the most-attended virtual event in UNT SLIS history. Founding this LISSA branch taught me that even library school students can “make it happen,” as the ALA Think Tank says, a lesson I have put to good use many times.</td>

          <td>If elected, I would work to increase the ALA membership's understanding of how our association functions, with a particular focus on library school students and other new members. Services for new librarians/association members have been my passion since I joined the profession; almost the entirety of my professional development work has been devoted to issues concerning new professionals. According to Library Journal, over 5000 students graduate from library school every year, but only a fraction of these join ALA, and those that do join are often confused about what ALA does and aren't aware of the opportunities and services it provides. Serving as an ALA Councilor-at-Large would give me a platform with which I could both promote the interests of new professionals within the association as well as reach out to those who aren't members.

Thank you for considering me for the office of ALA Councilor!</td>

However, librarians need to strengthen our ability to make the case for the importance of well-funded libraries in today's society. Whether in an academic environment, where rising costs threaten our ability to provide resources to our users, to the public library, where local systems face fierce budget competition, libraries are under a huge amount of pressure. All of this is occurring at a time when the need for free and open access to information is more important than ever. I believe that ALA is the most effective voice for libraries on a national level, and I hope that by participating in the Council I can lend my talents in support of those needs.</td>

For example, as Director of the Hackney Library at Barton College, we won the John Cotton Dana award for our fall open house program, "The Banned Book Tour." This was a great accomplishment not just because of the award but because it brought students into the library who had never been in before and it helped students to think about the library in a whole different way, but it took the whole library team to make this happen. I've also led successful restructuring and reorganization efforts, but it was due to the team's willingness to embrace new ideas that these were successful.</td>

I am concerned about the decreasing leadership opportunities in academic libraries, and its long-term effect on the profession. Many outstanding senior leaders have retired in the last few years. Replacing them has resulted in shortages of qualified staff at the middle and upper management of academic libraries. Branch libraries have been the traditional training ground for managers, but many have closed or been consolidated. Libraries have also flattened organizations, which has decreased the number managers and department heads.

Opportunities such as ALA’s Leadership Institute and Emerging Leaders Program provide philosophical underpinnings and mentorship. Professional associations can also provide leadership experiences through committee work, but library employees need an opportunity to apply their training within a library setting and develop practical, transferable skills.</td>

Furthermore, the need to ensure that these collections are accessible to all communities and not limited to those who can afford it is also of importance to me. The digital divide is a complex phenomenon with intricate layers requiring various approaches in order to address the problem. If elected to the Council I will strive to advocate for these issues and to pursue remedies through the organizational strength of ALA .

However, there is much that remains to be done. One of our biggest weaknesses as an organization has been the siloing of various types of librarianship. While there are many differences between our groups, we need to remember that there are more similarities that join us together and work to support each other. 

In these tough times, we need to focus on what brings us together as librarians, rather than what divides us from each other and distracts us from our shared goals. My concern is that I see us being weakened by fighting each other and losing track of the fact that first and foremost we are all united as librarians.</td>

From SRRT to ALSC to RUSA, I have encountered many librarians who have mentored me and have moved this organization forward, and I hope my candidacy and potential role on the Council will be a continuance of these varied and respected legacies.</td>

          <td>Federal Ethics rules require me to list my current position in biographical info. This is not an official duty. I do not represent my employer; I represent you. 

We live in interesting times. The economic stressors on Libraries and Librarians are great. We're asked to do more with less (and less, and less, and less…). The media portrays us as an anachronism; not needed because everything is online. 

As a thought leader in the Facebook group 'ALA Think Tank', I believe I have the pulse of the people. I can be your voice on ALA Council.

My interests include: 
• Bettering communication among library staff, veterans and rookies, via social media. 
• Improving digital services and access to technology. 
• Providing ready access to health information especially in times of widespread emergencies, whether natural or man-made.

As a library advocate, we have to be in-tune to the needs of our community and understand that each community need is different.  

As library advocates we have to constantly prove our relevance and show why libraries matter and why libraries are an important function in our communities. We are faced with budget cuts and at times libraries are the first hit. As library stakeholders we need to show our passion for what we know to be true and show why we matter.

          <td>My desire to be on ALA council stems from two questions I would like to answer. First, ALA works hard to stress the importance of libraries and librarians to the public, but can we do more to communicate this importance to the profession itself? As a new librarian searching for that elusive full time job, the enormous amount of part time, temporary, and low salary jobs makes me wonder if those who run libraries really value those who work in them. How can we expect anyone to value us if we do not value ourselves? Secondly, many of my follow recent graduates are hesitant to join ALA because they do not see the value in it. How can we engage this important group of individuals and make ALA valuable to them (or at least communicate this to them) while continuing to serve the needs of the current members?</td>

I joined Marquette in 2006 after three years as Associate Dean of Libraries at the University of Arizona Libraries and thirteen years in leadership positions at the University of Iowa. I have extensively presented and published on topics related to diversity and leadership and have co-edited Advocacy, Outreach and the Nation’s Academic Libraries and Human Resources Management in Today’s Academic Library—as well as authored many articles and book chapters. I have written several papers on diversity and the management of libraries and also serve on the editorial board for portal: Libraries and the Academy.With a career spanning thirty five years, I have been an active member of ACRL and ALA since 1981. In 2011, ACRL honored me as Academic Research Librarian of the Year, its highest achievement award for an individual librarian. Presently, I am serving on ALA’s Budget Analysis and Review Committee and am also on the Board of Directors for the Center for Research Libraries.</td>

I firmly believe that through ALA Council we can strengthen our profession’s commitment to these values—within the association, our state chapters, and our libraries across the nation. My extensive work with and leadership in workplace diversity make me uniquely qualified to help ALA’s discussions in these areas move forward. Professional development is another critical area for today’s libraries. With more than 30 years as an ALA member and many years in ALA leadership, I know from personal experience the association’s critical role in this area. Given my 3 years as member of ALA’s Budget Analysis and Review Committee and my involvement in other ALA leadership initiatives, I believe I have a demonstrated record of experience with membership and would strive to be available and responsive to their concerns.</td>

My professional experience, current position as LIS program instructor and advisory board member, and experience serving on the DC Library Association Board, a diverse association serving all library types, provides a foundation for these contributions. I passionately believe that having a breadth of perspectives in LIS has informed and enriched my career.
