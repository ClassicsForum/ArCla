# ArCla
The Archives of Classical Scholarship (ArCla) assembles a directory to the archival papers (archives) of American classicists and classical archaeologists. 

A collaboration led by faculty at the University of Missouri's School of Information Science & Learning Technologies (SISLT, Sarah Buchanan) and Department of Classical Studies (David Schenker), this project is funded by a 2017 Richard Wallace Faculty Incentive Grant.
